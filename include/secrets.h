  Summary:   Device and WiFi specfic details go here such as 
             SSID, password and hostname. Also some are used
             for OTA updates and the about page.

  Notes:     deviceFamily and softwareVersion are used by your
             remote update server to determine if a new update is
             available for this device. If you need multiple devices
             with identical firmware you can use the same for all.

             It wouldn't be a bad idea to combine these strings as the
             filename: mydevice-12.10.21.bin to make comparisons easier.
